2019 was a big year, I celebrated 1k followers on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ismail_elazizi/) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/ismailelazizi), I became a Figma ambassador, I wrote 2 articles, and T**he important Thing** I got the chance to contribute in the Moroccan design community with 10 design talks/workshops all over the country.
### What I learned from 2019

One of the great lessons I learned this year was _“_**_Start Before You’re Ready_**_”_ by [Matthew Encina](https://twitter.com/matthewencina) in his TED talk, the same lesson was from [Zig Ziglar](https://twitter.com/TheZigZiglar) who said, _“_**_You don’t have to be great to start, but you have to start to be great_**_”_. I can’t describe how much I achieved implementing this concept, whenever I felt I am not ready for new adventures this quote popped up in my mind remaining me to take action even I am not ready. Because simply, I will never be ready!

I got to learn also a great lesson from my best teacher [Chris Do](https://twitter.com/theChrisDo) who said _“_**_the best way to learn is to teach_**_”_, this was the spark of all the workshops/talks, I always get to learn too many things from teaching and guiding people.



### let’s start from the beginning

This year was my second year as a part-time UX/UI designer at [Obytes](https://www.obytes.com/) and a student during the rest of the time (big data and cloud computing student), to be honest, I was not giving too much time and energy toward study, that’s why my marks were not good enough in the first semester (wait for the second one 😱). After finishing the first semester on 5th January I went to my hometown Errachidia to see my big family and spend a great time with them, that was easy for me because I work remotely 😍, I was working that time on [Barmej](https://barmej.com/) project helping engineers create the Arabic online platform that offers beginner to advanced courses in programming.  
After starting the second semester and within our study’s program we had to do a project that should solve a social problem. As a group of 4 people we chose to do some workshops to help students in our school to learn how to design, the idea was great, we set a date we make a poster and here we go.

### ⏰ 13 February 📍Mohammedia 🎯 “Introduction to design”

**📚 Slides 👉** [**https://bit.ly/2JlaJEu**](https://bit.ly/2JlaJEu)

Sharing design’s knowledge was the main title of this day, I made a presentation about design principles and how to use them to create good design, then we had a practice session in which we asked the students to design a poster for a book day, we gave them the assets then we guide them through the process answering their questions.

As someone who is a huge fan of Figma, I could not miss the chance without mentioning that tool, I saw how easy it was for the students to use it and achieve great results. I was surprised by the quality of work they get at the end.

The day is over, I was so happy, I shared the recap, the presentation, and the Attendees design on Facebook, thereafter, I got a message from my friend [Maroua Ezouhri](https://twitter.com/ezouhrimaroua) telling me how much she is proud of what I did, and because she was a Figma ambassador she asked me if I can be as well, I accepted for sure. She didn’t stop here, she told me that she had an upcoming talk at Forloop Morooco event and she would like to get me half of her talk’s time to prepare something, I accept again.

> Hi [Maroua](https://twitter.com/ezouhrimaroua), Thank you for the great support!

### ⏰ 23 Mars📍Marrakech 🎯 “bridging the gap between designers and developers”

**📚 Slides 👉** [**https://bit.ly/2UNTNbO**](https://t.co/pnx30ggh5F)

At Forloop Morocco event, I had the pleasure to share the stage with amazing developers and designers sharing great insights, and since most of the attendees were developers, my talk was about bridging the gap between designers and developers with some web design principles and hacks for developers to bridge the gap.

after sharing the post on Facebook I got a message from a friend and head of an IT club in Errachidia (my hometown) asking me about a workshop in the city, I was in Casablanca at that time, I told him I will have the pleasure to do that as soon as I am there.

### ⏰ 10 April📍Errachidia 🎯 “Introduction to design in Figma”

**📚 Slides 👉** [**https://bit.ly/2JlaJEu**](https://bit.ly/2JlaJEu)

Back to Errachidia during a school vacation, I had the honor to share design knowledge in my hometown under Figma’s umbrella, the Workshop was the first event of this type in the city, it was about design basics using Figma, I am proud of its success and I am very grateful to the attendees that accepted the invitation and made the event very interactive.

### ⏰ 27 April 📍Mohammedia 🎯 “Design System in Figma”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*jr_kHV87zLlLR78d)

**📚 Slides 👉** [**https://bit.ly/2GTCXDU**](https://bit.ly/2GTCXDU?fbclid=IwAR0btP_dNSbe82MZSuR0ByG5pwWCZRmWLQjw-32b6cbcKLVQdWWGItgPV88)

Back to Mohammedia, a friends of mine are organizing a digital days event in the school, they reached me out for a workshop, and since I was very interested about design system at that time, I couldn’t miss the chance without talking about it (_That’s how I do it, whenever I feel interested in something and I want to make a progress on it, I make a workshop about it. The best way for learning is teaching_)

During the workshop we started first by digging deep into Figma, Then we jumped to what is a design system? why we use it? and how to build one using Figma. In the end, we had a practice session in which we discussed a use case (A live watching/chatting films app), we went through the whole design process from having the idea to testing the design.

### ⏰ 25 May📍Rabat 🎯 “UX/UI Design 101”

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*KQkU1yrB_7XrZXv-)

As [DevC Casablanca](https://www.facebook.com/groups/DevC.Casablanca/) members we believe in sharing knowledge, my friend [Soufian Foukahi](https://twitter.com/souffanda) asked me why not doing something within DevC, I was very happy about that, but what topic should I talk about? inspired by [Mohammed Aboullaite](https://twitter.com/laytoun) tour about Docker 101, I chose to have a UX/UI Design 101.

During Ramadan, and after finishing the second semester which was a whole mess, we set a date for the workshop in Rabat. and from there we start the UX/UI Design 101 tour.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*f_3Q-2PyTixIZEv6)

During the workshop, I tried to give the essentials of UX/UI, definition, fundamentals, process, and how to get the maximum from Figma during this process, at the end I did a quick simulation in which I went through all the UX/UI design phases.

I really like the open conversation and great questions we had in this workshop, it is my preferable way of presenting, I get to know how people think to understand what they need, every question was a spark of a new topic that I was amused to open.

  

### ⏰ 17 July 📍Casablanca 🎯 “UX/UI Design 101”

After Rabat, UX/UI 101 was in Casablanca, I was surprised by the number of attendees, it was another occasion to talk about UI/UX with different people from different background.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*73xy1KRyvnm1xgSZ)

During the conversation, I saw how Moroccan companies are more interested in UX/UI design than before and ready to hire more designers because they start to see the value of design and how implementing it the right way improves the business.

### ⏰ 04 September 🎙️Podcast 🎯 “UI/UX Design”

I had the honor to get invited to the [Pentim](https://pentium.live/) podcast hosted by the amazing [Jeffery](https://twitter.com/JefferyHus) & [Abderrahim](https://twitter.com/Ginix_Labs) to talk about UI/UX design, we had a great conversation covered pretty mush all thing about the topic, Please Make sure to check the episode here [👉 UI/UX with Ismail El Azizi 👈](https://anchor.fm/pentium/episodes/UIUX-Design-w-Ismail-e57s4f?fbclid=IwAR03wbE8GcekfpScLnenF-FlcWQBId2nQVPz3mkA3QceMmSduxjhZVc19Cs) as well as other great tech episodes.

Back to Marrakech, My friend [Mohamed Benhida](https://twitter.com/simo_benhida) reached me out for a talk in his upcoming event, I couldn’t say no, it was a great occasion to meet friends and get prepared to Devoxx Morocco after my talk got accepted.

Back to 2018, I was an attendee at [Devoxx Morocco](https://devoxx.ma/) in Marrakech, I lived 3 days full of fun and learning, I was not thinking I will get to talk on the event the next year. during the CFP of 2019, I got the idea that I am not ready and let me wait for the next year, again never wait until you’re ready, my friend [Soufian Foukahi](https://twitter.com/souffanda) told me just fill the form and send it, never mind if they accept you or not, I did, And they did accept me! I was very happy to have the chance to be withing great speakers coming from all o er the world.

I spend 6 days in Agadir, 3 days with [Obytes](https://www.obytes.com/) team Chilling and having fun after a long time of hard-working, and 3 days as a speaker and attendee at [Devoxx Morocco](https://devoxx.ma/).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/0*Cx_7LnvHg1fgb3ZX)

The experience of [Devoxx](https://devoxx.ma/) was pretty good, I got to meet amazing people from the community and attend great sessions all-around Tech. I had also celebrated a Moroccan party full of joy and fun on the second day which was my birthday. Best coincidence EVER!

Back to my talk, it was on the first day, a quickie format of 15 minutes in which I talked about design Spring and how it is a superpower that can let you go fast-forward into the future to see your finished product and customer reactions before making any expensive commitments.

### ⏰ 27 November 📍Mohammedia 🎯 “UX/UI Design 101”

After Rabat and Casablanca, I got the occasion to do the UX/UI design 101 in Mohammedia as a part of [N7Geeks](https://web.facebook.com/n7geeks), the IT club in my school. I really admire the fact that students are interested in design, and came from other schools and universities to learn about UX/UI design.

I got many questions from people ready to shift to UX/UI design and don’t know HOW. Likely, I have an article that I wrote recently in which I shared a guide on how to get started. You can check it here: [👉 The Link 👈](https://ismailelazizi.com/blog/ux-ui-design-how-to-get-started)

### A dream

my dream is to do the UX/UI design 101 in every Moroccan city, I really enjoy being close to people, talking and learning for them. the good news is that we are a team this year, the dream is shared with the amazing [Maroua Ezouhri](https://twitter.com/ezouhrimaroua) and [Oussama Hyad](https://twitter.com/milleminial) who are already started.

> Stay tuned, the best is yet to come!

### Final word

I want to thank all the amazing people I get to know in 2019, people from all the communities, people ready to share without expecting anything in return, people believe that community matters.
