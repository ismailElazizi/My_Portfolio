Contrast also helps create relationships between elements. If all the elements in the design are with the same size how will the user discover which element is most important or need to be looked at first. using scale is the easiest ways to create a dynamic, interesting layout and add drama to a design.

> **Tip**: Let the variation of size be recognizable. the best way is to do that by doubling the size.

Space also can play an important role in organizing design elements. By surrounding important elements with some extra blank space you will draw more attention to that element and make it stand out.

> **Tip**: The amount of space between elements defines the relationship between them.
