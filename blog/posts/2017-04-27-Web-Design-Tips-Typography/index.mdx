This article is made to help you improve your type skills and understand how to use type by following some tips.

> let’s start!

# Tip 1

**One font is enough**: it is about focus, because choices confuse. I usually use Google font, they offer an directory of open source web fonts.  I recommend [_Roboto_](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as your font to start with. it is modern, clean and simple, with 12 styles.

# Tip 2

Use **contrast** to direct the reader’s attention to the important messages. With Roboto font you have three methods: color, weight and size, choose one!

# Tip 3

Find  **axis**  to align: More than to element need to have aligned, for vertical, align to left edge, for horizontal align to baseline.

When you change, change bigger, the variation should be recognizable. you can do that by doubling the point size.
