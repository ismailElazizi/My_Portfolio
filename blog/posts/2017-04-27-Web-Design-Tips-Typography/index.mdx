This article is made to help you improve your type skills and understand how to use type by following some tips.

> let’s start!

# Tip 1

**One font is enough**: it is about focus, because choices confuse. I usually use Google font, they offer an directory of open source web fonts.  I recommend [_Roboto_](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as your font to start with. it is modern, clean and simple, with 12 styles.

# Tip 2

Use **contrast** to direct the reader’s attention to the important messages. With Roboto font you have three methods: color, weight and size, choose one!
